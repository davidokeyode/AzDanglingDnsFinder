# AzDanglingDnsFinder
AzDanglingDnsFinder is a PowerShell script designed to identify DNS names that may be vulnerable to sub-domain takeover by checking if they point to Azure services that no longer exist or are not currently in use. The tool checks for dangling DNS records associated with Azure services like ApiManagement, WebApp, FrontDoor, and TrafficManager.
